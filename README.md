# The conflict everyone could solve
Purposefully create a merge conflict to solve
*here's another line
*and a third one just there
*I thinkcoding is the best

There once was a conflict named **conflict.**
It was conflicting down a road one day when it saw ***the conflict resolver.***
The ***conflict resolver*** ordered it to stop existing. And as fast as the **conflict** once came to existence, it dissapeared.

**THE END**
