# The conflict everyone could solve
Purposefully create a merge conflict to solve
There once was a conflict named **conflict.**
It was conflicting down a road one day when it saw ***the conflict resolver.***
The ***conflict resolver*** ordered it to stop existing. And as fast as the **conflict** once came to existence, it dissapeared.
I think that creating conflict is a good way to learn how to deal with them.
And like a great man said :
**Stop existing CONFLICT RESOLVER**
----------
**THE END**
