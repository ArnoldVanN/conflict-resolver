# The conflict everyone could solve
Purposefully create a merge conflict to solve

There once was a conflict named **conflict.**
It was conflicting down a road one day when it saw ***the conflict resolver.***
The ***conflict resolver*** ordered it to stop existing. And as fast as the **conflict** once came to existence, it dissapeared.
----------
**THE END**
